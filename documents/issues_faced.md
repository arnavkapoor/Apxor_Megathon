# Issues Faced

This document lists broadly the major issues faced by the team during the course of this project.

## 1.Incompatible Versions

    Superset is built on Flask App Builder framework. Due to Flask App builder not supporting certain versions of Flask the issue propped up. There was no documentation to help us resolve the issue and the team had to research and figure it own our own. Issue number #5958 raised this but was not solved . We thus contributed back to the community with our fix which we're sure will help developers in the future.

## 2. Poor Documentation

    The documentation for both Superset and Flask App Builder framework is not complete and comprehensive. The team had to look through the source code to figure out what had to be modified. Better documentation would have served hours of code review. The team contributed and improved the documentation where they could.

## 3. Community

    The superset community was not very responsive and queries took days to be resolved. There are plenty of issues we faced which were already raised and are still unresolved.
