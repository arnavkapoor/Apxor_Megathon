## Details of the App

As we did not have acess to the PointMatter we have created a dummy application to show the proof of concept. This can be easily scaled to PointMatter.
This demonstrates the integration of the two apps and User Credentials are passed seamlessly.
This project uses OAuth for security .
There is an option which redirects you to Superset . Ensure that same email id is registered for both.
Also ensure that Superset is running on the port below.

## Ports being used :
Superset : 8088
Dummy App : 8080
